# By default, XChat based IRC software, when started-up, or run for first time,
# it starts to use local network, to connect to the internet. To prevent that,
# and to force it, to use Tor proxy (a Socks5 server):
#
# /set net_proxy_host 10.152.152.10
# /set net_proxy_port 9101
# /set net_proxy_type 3
# /set net_proxy_use 0
# IP HARDCODED

# Technical note: Do not worry. 0 is not equal to "off". 0 stands for "All".
#                 Check yourself https://toxin.jottit.com/xchat_set_variables
net_proxy_use = 0

# XChat should not use the same circuit/exit server as other Tor applications.
# Otherwise activity in different applications could be correlated to the same
# pseudonym. There is a way to prevent that.
# It is called stream isolation. We use IsolateSOCKSAuth,
# see https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual-dev.html.en
# The password is actually not required, but it does not hurt either.
# Will probably not hurt on Tor 0.2.2 and below.
# Works with Tor 0.2.3 and above.

# Get rid of protocol leaks:
# a DCC session can reveal IP address, etc. identd flag can reveal your
# username which you use to login in your OS(Windows/Linux/Unix/MacOS) profile.

#
# /set dcc_auto_chat 0
# /set dcc_auto_resume OFF
# /set dcc_auto_send 0
# /set dcc_auto_recv 0
# /set irc_hide_version ON
# /set identd OFF <-- NOT working on all XChat-based IRC software.
# But still highly suggested to include & use it.
# Probably not needed on UNIX, source: http://xchat.org/faq/#q21

# If you use your own comment instead of default values, then these data are

# By default, XChat based IRC software uses your platform OS(Operating System)s
# login user name as your nickname, user name, real name.  To prevent leaking
# that, and, to use your own choice of nickname, realname, username:
#
# ***Pseudonymous vs. anonymous IRC use.***
# Actually IRC is pseudonymous. Your nickname might also reveal something about
# your origin, interests, etc. You can make IRC more anonymous by choosing a more
# meaningless nickname. Use the following defaults if you want to be more anonymous.
# If user, user_ and user___ are already taken, add more _ or start using user1,
# user2, user3, etc. Or if the irc network auto assigns your a nickname, i.e.
# guest532, stick with that nickname.
#
# Of course, you are free to continue using IRC in a pseudonymous manner.
# In that case, instant of user, choose your nickname.

# Use a more common nick completion suffix:
# When you write the first few characters of a nickname followed by tab,
# it will, by XChat default, complete the nickname and ", " behind the
# nickname. The behavior is XChat specific. The " :" is more more common
# for more common clients such as mIRC.
